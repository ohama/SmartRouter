# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-07)

**Core value:** Route every request to the model best suited to it — fast 35B for simple work, expensive 122B only when the task or signals justify it — while protecting 122B from concurrent overload.
**Current focus:** Phase 3 — Concurrency Gate (Phase 2 complete)

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 6 (SSE Streaming Pass-Through) — COMPLETE ✓
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase — COMPLETE ✓
Status: Phase 2 complete — SSE implementation + 8 streaming tests green; 30/30 tests pass
Last activity: 2026-05-07 — Completed 02-02-STREAMING-TESTS-PLAN.md — all 5 SSE pitfalls have code mitigations + passing tests

Progress: [█████░░░░░] ~29% (5 of ~17 plans estimated)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: ~7 min
- Total execution time: ~21 min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation | 3/3 | ~21 min | 7 min |
| 02-sse-streaming-pass-through | 2/2 | ~24 min | 12 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-02 (5 min), 01-03 (13 min), 02-01 (18 min), 02-02 (6 min)
- Trend: 02-02 quick because test infrastructure pattern was well-researched; all fixes were auto-resolved

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: SSE streaming (Phase 2) and concurrency gate (Phase 3) are atomic units — must not be split
- Roadmap: graph_indexing no-fallback rule ships in same phase as health probing (Phase 4)
- Roadmap: Phase 3 depends on Phase 1 only (not Phase 2); Phases 2 and 3 have no cross-dependency
- 01-01: `dotnet new slnx` unavailable in SDK 10.0.203 — SmartRouter.slnx written manually in XML (no functional difference)
- 01-01: launchSettings.json has no applicationUrl — appsettings.json is single source of truth for Kestrel binding (OPS-04)
- 01-02: RoutingConfig is a plain F# record in Core (no IOptions<T>); Cli constructs it from appsettings.json at composition time (ARCH-01)
- 01-02: taskToDecision is utility-only (compile-time DU completeness anchor); routeRequest/tryTaskTable read config.TaskTable Map at runtime (ROUT-05 locked decision)
- 01-02: MessageRole.System DU case shadows System namespace — test code must use String.replicate not System.String.replicate
- 01-03: wireJsonOptions uses standard STJ without FSharpConverter for incoming wire body — FSharp.SystemTextJson record converter requires all fields to be present; standard STJ tolerates missing optional fields
- 01-03: Lazy probe returns Result<string, RouterError> (not ModelInfo record) — probe failure maps directly to ModelUnavailable, no silent fallback to empty model id
- 01-03: F# interpolated strings reject escaped quotes inside interpolation expressions — use sprintf for error messages containing quotes
- 01-03: Phase 3 concurrency gate swap is one-line DI change: AddSingleton<IUpstreamClient>(QueueDispatcher(QwenUpstreamClient())) in CompositionRoot
- 02-01: F# task{} does not support do! in finally blocks — enumerator.DisposeAsync() called explicitly in each catch arm (normal, cancel, error); semantically equivalent to finally
- 02-01: StreamAsync uses direct let! resp = client.SendAsync(..., HttpCompletionOption.ResponseHeadersRead, ct) — no task{return!...} wrapper
- 02-01: StreamingTests deferred to Plan 02-02 — 02-01 ships the implementation only; 02-02 owns the fake-Kestrel integration test harness
- 02-02: ConfigurationManager.AddInMemoryCollection requires explicit cast to IConfigurationBuilder — extension method on interface, not concrete type
- 02-02: F# task{} finally blocks do not allow do! — use .GetAwaiter().GetResult() for async teardown (StopAsync/DisposeAsync) in test helpers
- 02-02: ctx.RequestAborted in Kestrel fires on TCP socket close (response.Dispose()), not on CancellationToken.Cancel() — cancellation test must close the socket
- 02-02: startTestRouter requires full Routing section in AddInMemoryCollection — validateConfig (called via DI singleton factory) checks all canonical tasks are present

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- NuGet package versions all resolved at pinned versions — no concerns remaining.
- Graphify task field string literals ("graph_indexing", etc.) must be confirmed against actual Graphify client when it is built.
- Scenario B (live upstream HTTP 200 passthrough) was not verified during Phase 1 execution because Qwen 35B was not running. User explicitly approved on automated evidence (502-on-down was already proven; full passthrough will be exercised during Phase 6 deploy + first Hermes/Graphify smoke).
